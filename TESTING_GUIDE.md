   ```

4. Verify `planId` exists in subscription document
5. Check plan exists in `subscription_plans` collection

### **If Plan Name Not Showing:**

1. Verify `planId` in subscription matches a plan document ID
2. Check plan document has `name` field
3. Look for Firestore permission errors in Logcat
