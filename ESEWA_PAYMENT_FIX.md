# eSewa Payment Integration - Fix Applied ✅

## Problem

The app was crashing with `ClassNotFoundException` when trying to initiate eSewa payment:

```
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.esewa.android.sdk.payment.EsewaConfiguration
```

## Root Cause

The code was trying to use incorrect package names and class names for the eSewa SDK. The actual
package structure in the `eSewaSdk.aar` file is:

- Package: `com.f1soft.esewapaymentsdk` (not `com.esewa.android.sdk.payment`)
- Classes:
    - `EsewaConfiguration`
    - `EsewaPayment`
    - `EsewaPaymentActivity`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Package Imports

Changed from reflection-based approach to direct imports:

```kotlin
import com.f1soft.esewapaymentsdk.EsewaConfiguration
import com.f1soft.esewapaymentsdk.EsewaPayment
import com.f1soft.esewapaymentsdk.ui.screens.EsewaPaymentActivity
```

### 2. Updated Payment Initialization

Now using direct object creation with constructor parameters:

```kotlin
val userId = FirebaseAuth.getInstance().currentUser?.uid ?: ""
val productId = "${System.currentTimeMillis()}_${userId}_${planId}"

// Create eSewa configuration with required parameters
val eSewaConfiguration = EsewaConfiguration(
    clientId = CLIENT_ID,
    secretKey = CLIENT_SECRET,
    environment = "TEST"
)

// Create payment object with required parameters
val eSewaPayment = EsewaPayment(
    amount = planPrice.toString(),
    productName = planName,
    productUniqueId = productId,
    callbackUrl = "https://movieflix.com/callback"
)

// Start payment activity
val intent = Intent(this, EsewaPaymentActivity::class.java)
intent.putExtra("ESEWA_CONFIGURATION", eSewaConfiguration)
intent.putExtra("ESEWA_PAYMENT", eSewaPayment)
startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE_PAYMENT)
```

### 3. Fixed Build Dependencies

Also fixed the build error caused by mixing old Android Support libraries with AndroidX:

- Replaced `com.android.support:cardview-v7:27.1.1` with `androidx.cardview:cardview:1.0.0`
- Removed `com.android.support:design:27.1.1` (already covered by Material components)

## Files Modified

1. **ESewaPaymentHandler.kt** - Updated with correct SDK imports and usage
2. **app/build.gradle.kts** - Fixed dependency conflicts

## Test Credentials (Already Configured)

- **Client ID**: `JB0BBQ4aD0UqIThFJwAKBgAXEUkEGQUBBAwdOgABHD4DChwUAB0R`
- **Client Secret**: `BhwIWQQADhIYSxILExMcAgFXFhcOBwAKBgAXEQ==`
- **Environment**: `TEST`
- **Product Code**: `EPAYTEST`

## How to Test

1. Open the app
2. Navigate to the **Subscribe** tab
3. Select any subscription plan
4. Click on the **eSewa** payment button
5. The eSewa payment screen should now appear without crashing

## Expected Flow

1. User selects a plan → clicks eSewa
2. `ESewaPaymentHandler` activity launches
3. eSewa SDK payment screen appears
4. User logs in with eSewa credentials (test account)
5. User confirms payment
6. On success: subscription is activated in Firestore
7. User is redirected back to the app

## What Was Wrong Before

The original code was using:

- ❌ `com.esewa.android.sdk.payment.EsewaConfiguration` (wrong package)
- ❌ Reflection-based class loading
- ❌ Incorrect method names (e.g., `clientId()` instead of `setClientId()`)

## What's Correct Now

- ✅ `com.f1soft.esewapaymentsdk.EsewaConfiguration` (correct package)
- ✅ Direct import and usage
- ✅ Correct property assignments
- ✅ Type-safe code without reflection

## Notes

- The eSewaSdk.aar file is already in place at `app/libs/eSewaSdk.aar`
- The SDK is properly configured in build.gradle.kts
- The payment handler is registered in AndroidManifest.xml
- Firebase Firestore integration is ready to store subscription data

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful**
✅ **APK Installed**
✅ **Ready to Test**
