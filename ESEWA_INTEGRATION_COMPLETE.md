## 📋 What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Download eSewa SDK

You need to download the official eSewa Android SDK:

#### Option A: From eSewa Developer Portal

1. Visit: https://developer.esewa.com.np/#/download
2. Download the **Android SDK** (.aar file)
3. It should be named something like: `eSewaSdk.aar`

#### Option B: Contact eSewa Support

- Email: support@esewa.com.np
- Request the Android SDK for integration

### Step 2: Add SDK to Your Project

1. **Create the libs folder** (if it doesn't exist):
   ```
   C:\Users\Admin\StudioProjects\MovieFlix\app\libs\
   ```

2. **Copy the .aar file** into the libs folder:
   ```
   C:\Users\Admin\StudioProjects\MovieFlix\app\libs\eSewaSdk.aar
   ```

3. **Important**: The file MUST be named exactly `eSewaSdk.aar`

### Step 3: Sync Your Project

1. Open Android Studio
2. Click **File → Sync Project with Gradle Files**
3. Wait for the sync to complete
4. Check for any errors in the Build panel

### Step 4: Uncomment Payment Code

After adding the SDK, open `ESewaPaymentHandler.kt` and uncomment the payment code:

Find this section (around line 47):

```kotlin
// ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Uncomment this after adding eSewa SDK .aar file

/*
// Configure eSewa
val eSewaConfiguration = ESewaConfiguration()
    .clientId(CLIENT_ID)
    ...
*/
```

**Remove the `/*` and `*/` comments** to activate the payment code.

### Step 5: Test the Integration

1. **Build** your app
2. **Run** on a device or emulator
3. Navigate to **Subscribe tab**
4. Select a plan
5. Click **eSewa button**
6. You should see the eSewa payment screen

## 🔐 Your Test Credentials

✅ **Client ID**: `JB0BBQ4aD0UqIThFJwAKBgAXEUkEGQUBBAwdOgABHD4DChwUAB0R`  
✅ **Client Secret**: `BhwIWQQADhIYSxILExMcAgFXFhcOBwAKBgAXEQ==`  
✅ **Environment**: `TEST` (eSewa Test Environment)  
✅ **Product Code**: `EPAYTEST`

These are already configured in `ESewaPaymentHandler.kt`.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User selects a subscription plan** in the Subscribe tab
2. **Clicks eSewa button**
3. **ESewaPaymentHandler activity launches**
4. **eSewa payment screen appears**
5. **User completes payment**
6. **On success**: Subscription is created in Firestore
7. **User gets confirmation toast**

## 📱 What Happens After Payment

### Successful Payment:

- ✅ Subscription document created in Firestore
- ✅ Fields: userId, planId, planName, price, duration, paymentMethod, transactionId, status,
  startDate, expiryDate
- ✅ User's subscription becomes "Active"
- ✅ Welcome dialog no longer shows
- ✅ User can watch full movies

### Failed/Cancelled Payment:

- ❌ Toast shows "Payment cancelled" or "Payment failed"
- ❌ No subscription created
- ❌ User returns to Subscribe tab

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "eSewa SDK not yet configured" message

**Solution**: You haven't added the `eSewaSdk.aar` file yet. Follow Steps 1-3 above.

### Problem: Gradle sync fails with "Cannot find eSewaSdk"

**Solution**:

- Check that the file is in `app/libs/eSewaSdk.aar`
- Check the filename is exactly `eSewaSdk.aar` (case-sensitive)
- Try **Build → Clean Project** → **Build ��� Rebuild Project**

### Problem: "Unresolved reference: ESewaConfiguration"

**Solution**: The SDK is not properly added. Verify:

1. File is in correct location
2. Gradle sync completed successfully
3. Restart Android Studio

### Problem: Payment screen doesn't open

**Solution**:

1. Check you uncommented the code in `ESewaPaymentHandler.kt`
2. Check Logcat for errors
3. Verify test credentials are correct

## 🎉 Next Steps

After eSewa is working:

1. **Test with real test amounts** (eSewa provides test cards)
2. **Implement Khalti** (similar process)
3. **Add payment verification** (recommended for production)
4. **Test subscription expiry** (wait for expiry date to pass)
5. **Go live** with production credentials

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control (they're already in code for testing)
2. **Use test environment** for development
3. **Switch to production credentials** before app release
4. **Implement payment verification** on backend for security
5. **Test thoroughly** before releasing to users

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. **Payment verification**: Verify transactions on your backend (Firebase Cloud Functions)
2. **Secret keys**: Don't expose secret keys in the app
3. **SSL**: Use HTTPS for all API calls
4. **Validation**: Validate all payment responses
5. **Logging**: Log all transactions for debugging
