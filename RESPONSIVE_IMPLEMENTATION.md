## 💡 How It Works

```kotlin
// In any composable:
val sizes = getResponsiveSizes()

// Automatically gets correct size for current device:
Text("Title", fontSize = sizes.titleSize) // 20sp, 24sp, or 28sp
Card(modifier = Modifier.width(sizes.movieCardWidth)) // 140dp, 180dp, or 220dp
```

The system **automatically detects** the screen size and provides the right dimensions!
